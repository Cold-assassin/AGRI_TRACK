## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 6 – Bridging The Gap Between Farmers And Their Rightful Subsidies**

Many rural farmers remain unaware of government subsidies due to complex paperwork, language barriers, digital illiteracy, and exploitation by middlemen and officials.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Millions of farmers miss out on vital government subsidies due to complex paperwork, language gaps, low digital literacy, and exploitation by middlemen. This project cuts through the noise.

We built an AI-powered assistant that speaks in simple English or Hinglish supports 17+ language, helps farmers understand and access the schemes they deserve, and protects them from misinformation and fraud—making support truly accessible, understandable, and actionable.

No more middlemen. No more confusion. Just the truth, straight to the farmer.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`OneCode`

### Team Member:  
- Prakhar Kumar (https://github.com/Cold-assassin)

### Your Approach: 
-Why I Chose This Problem
Having spent my childhood in the Northeast, I witnessed the disconnect between the government and the farming community — especially regarding subsidies. When I moved to Meerut, where agriculture is a lifeline, I saw firsthand how farmers struggle with both ignorance about subsidies and exploitation by corrupt officials. It became clear to me that there was a pressing need for a solution that could bridge this gap and empower farmers with the knowledge they deserve.

-Key Challenges I Addressed
1.Lack of Awareness: Farmers often don't know about available subsidies or how to access them. This lack of awareness is compounded by complicated government language and processes.
2.Corruption and Exploitation: Even when farmers are aware of subsidies, they are often misled or denied access by officials who exploit their ignorance.
3.Technological Barriers: Farmers in rural areas may have limited access to technology or struggle with digital literacy, making it difficult to utilize online resources.

-Breakthroughs & Pivots During the Hackathon
1.Multi-Language Support: I realized that to truly serve farmers, the solution needed to break language barriers. Integrating Groq AI’s ability to respond in both English and Hinglish was a game-changer, making the system more accessible to farmers from all backgrounds.
2.Transparency via Blockchain: Inspired by the idea of immutable records, I decided to integrate Stellar for its blockchain-based transaction system. This ensures that all subsidy-related activities are recorded transparently, reducing the chances of manipulation or fraud.
3.Real-time Updates with Fluvio: Realizing that farmers need to stay updated on changes in subsidy schemes, I integrated Fluvio’s real-time streaming capabilities to keep both farmers and government agencies informed — ensuring a seamless exchange of information.

These breakthroughs weren’t just technical solutions but also crucial steps towards building trust and enabling transparency in a space that is rife with corruption.
